* rgemulla/spacemacs-layers
This repository contains some custom [[http:spacemacs.org][Spacemacs ]]layers that I found useful.

** Installation
Copy the desired layer(s) into the private layers directory of Spacemacs
(defaults to =~/.spacemacs.d/private=). Then add them to
~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ in the ~.spacemacs~ file.
** Provided layers
- [[file:+lang/elpy][elpy]]: work with Python in a style similar to [[http:ess.r-project.org][ESS]] (alternative to ~python~
  layer of Spacemacs).
- [[file:+intl/umlauts/][umlauts]]: Make better use of umlauts when using a German keyboard layout.
- [[file:+source-control/vc/][vc]]: Integrate Emacs version control into Spacemacs.
- [[file:+web-services/web-search/][web-search]]: Quick access to web search and Google translate (alternative to
  ~search-engine~ layer of Spacemacs).
