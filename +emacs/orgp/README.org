* orgp layer
Additions/improvements for ~org~ layer of [[http:spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]].
- Integrated packages
  - [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]] calendar framework
  - [[https://github.com/Malabarba/org-agenda-property][org-agenda-property]] to display properties in the agenda buffer
  # - [[https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle][helm-org-rifle]] to quickly search through org files (works with both ~helm~
  #   and ~ivy~ layer)
- Show associated timestamp of a headline in the breadcrumb
- Various customizations for the agenda view
  - Functionality to apply custom faces for each tag in the agenda view
  - Functionality to add a pagebreak before each new data in the agenda view
  - Functionality to disable mouse-over faces in the agenda view
  - Functionality to hide time grid lines that overlap with an appointment (see
    layer variable =orgp/org-agenda-time-grid-hide-when-appointment=)
  - Custom comparator to sort agenda items such that full-day events come first,
    then events with a timestamp, then the TODO items
- Functionality to tangle a single src block to a file
- Functionality to copy a single src block to kill ring
- Functionality to tangle all src blocks in a subtree to a file
- Functionality to export the current subtree to a temporary HTML file for
  inclusion elsewhere (see =orgp/orgp/org-subtree-htmlize-to-temp-file=)
- More useful return key for Evil
  - in insert mode, use =evil-org-return=
  - in normal mode, use =org-open-at-point= when point is on a link, else use
    =evil-ret=
- Add support for ~callto~ links
- Let ~org-babel~ execute =bat= code blocks (using =cmdproxy.exe=)
- Follow links to [[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] library items (see comments in [[file:local/Org%20Link.js][Org Link.js]] for how to
  do this)
- Modifies [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-sticky-header][org-sticky-header]] to show full path unfontified in header line
  (enable with layer variable =org-enable-sticky-header=)
- Additional keybindings
  - Quickly reveal things around point
  - Access to ~org-babel~

** Customizations for agenda view
Disabled by default. Example usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; hook to change appearance of agenda view
(defun my/org-agenda-finalize-hook ()
  (save-excursion
    ;; color agenda items by their tag (faces need to be defined somewhere)
    (orgp/org-agenda-color-by-tag "personal" 'my/org-agenda-calendar-event-personal-face)
    (orgp/org-agenda-color-by-tag "work" 'my/org-agenda-calendar-event-anniversary-face)

    ;; add a pagebreak before every new day
    (orgp/org-agenda-pagebreak-before-new-date)

    ;; don't change the face on mouse-over
    (orgp/org-agenda-modify-mouse-face)))

;; enable the above hook
(add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook 'my/org-agenda-finalize-hook t)

;; show page breaks as horizontal lines
(add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook 'turn-on-page-break-lines-mode)

;; sort agenda items such that full-day events come first, then events with a
;; timestamp, then the TODO items
(setq org-agenda-cmp-user-defined 'orgp/org-agenda-cmp-todos-up)
(setq  org-agenda-sorting-strategy
       '((agenda user-defined-up time-up priority-down category-keep)
         (todo deadline-up)
         (tags ts-down priority-down alpha-up)
